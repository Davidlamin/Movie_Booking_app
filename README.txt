Cinema Booking Application
The Cinema Booking application is a user-friendly tool designed to simplify the process of selecting and booking movie seats. Built using the Tkinter library in Python, the application provides an intuitive graphical user interface that allows users to choose a movie genre, select a specific movie, pick a convenient time slot, and book seats interactively. This application is ideal for users who want a seamless and visual experience when booking cinema seats.

The application features several key functionalities. Users start by selecting a movie genre from a dropdown list. Based on the chosen genre, they can then select a specific movie. Once a movie is selected, time slot buttons appear, allowing users to choose a convenient time for the movie screening. The seat selection process is interactive, with available seats shown in green, selected seats in blue, and booked seats in brown. This visual representation makes it easy for users to see which seats are available and make their selections accordingly.

To use the application, you need to have Python 3.x installed, as well as Tkinter, which is included in the standard Python library. Run the script to launch the GUI, then follow the on-screen instructions to complete your booking. Start by selecting a genre and a movie, then choose a time slot. In the seat selection window, click on the available seats to select them and finalize your booking by clicking the "Book Seats" button. The application updates the seat status to reflect the booking, ensuring a clear and accurate representation of seat availability.

The Cinema Booking application is straightforward and efficient, making it an excellent choice for anyone looking to enhance their cinema booking experience. Whether you're a movie enthusiast or just someone looking to streamline the booking process, this application offers a practical solution.
